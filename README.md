This is currently an amorphous blob of a JavaScript-based app made during my time with the CareerFoundry Full-Stack Program. The default application, as per CareerFoundry, is to make a "Pokedex" - which is awesome, but I'd like to steer the app into being a "meal database" ... for recipes and answering, "What do you want to eat?"
